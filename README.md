## Buy/sell Classifier with Neural Networks (using Yahoo Finance)

This Python script automates a data pipeline to scrape financial data about stocks from Yahoo Finance and utilizes a neural network to predict whether a stock's price will increase or decrease in value.

### Features

* Automated data scraping from Yahoo Finance
* Preprocessing of financial data
* Neural network model for stock price prediction

### Disclaimer

This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for making financial decisions. The accuracy of the predictions cannot be guaranteed.

### Further Development

* Implement additional features like:
    * Support for different data sources
    * More sophisticated neural network architectures
    * Backtesting and evaluation of prediction performance (in progress)
